# Arduino Neural Network Robot
A robot made from the neural network base shown here https://img.youtube.com/vi/wtNaPLmpy1I/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/wtNaPLmpy1I
The robot navigates towards light sources while avoiding walls and some obstacles using an ultrasonic distance sensor.
The network was modified and is trained on startup.

# Note from creator of original network
A viewer created a method to train the network using a Python Script, Check it out here: https://github.com/JonComo/Arduino_weight_trainer
